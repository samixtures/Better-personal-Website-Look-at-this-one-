    Debugging.
    I was having a conversation with my younger brother about programming.
    The gist of it: programming seems relatively straightforward,
    a large part of it is the not so glamorous act of debugging,
    debugging can seem very frustrating considering it seems like a great
    hindrance to the completion of a project and its red font yells "bad"
    and it can be very unclear what the problem is based on the error message.
    But debugging can be quite fun and can lead one to a rabbit hole of knowledge,
    constantly learning what they actually told the comptuer to do vs what they thought
    they told the computer to do.
