    Parkinson's law: "work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion." (wikipedia)
    <br>
    I have 5 minutes to do write an entire IOS app. I won't do it in 5 minutes.
    If I worked on it for a few hours, I would likely be able to finish it properly,
    because creating a relatively simple IOS app takes at least a few hours, not a few
    minutes.

    I have 5 months to write an essay. It will likely take me 5 months to write the essay.
    If I'm give 1 week to write the essay I can probably do it in a week, because writing a decent
    essay takes several hours, but not several months.

    Procrastinating can make Parkinson's law work for you or against you.
    Depending on if you are truly giving yourself the time necessary to complete a task.

    Having too much time or too little time to do a task is problematic.

    Ideally, if you have 5 months to complete an essay, but it only takes a few weeks,
    you'd like to be able to finish it within the first few weeks right?
    Why don't we?
    Why does parkinson's law negatively occur with circumstances like that?
